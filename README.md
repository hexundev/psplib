# psplib

A simple library for PSP.

The goal of this was to learn more about the PSP GU and not have any GPL/LGPL dependencies like gLib2D.
The code is referenced from the psp sdk, sdk samples, OSLib source and libvita2d.

For audio, OSLib supports WAV, ADPCM and other formats.

## Features
- Basic input functions
- Loading PNG textures
- Setting views and projections
- Drawing sprites, rects or vertex arrays

## TODO
- Texture padding to po2
- Swizzling
- Drawing rects
- Texture formarts other than 8-bit RGBA
- Look at other other vertex and primitive formats for rendering
